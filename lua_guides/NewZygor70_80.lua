Avoid the Orange Areas on the Ground
|tip Overlord Drakuru will toss orange crystals at you, which will explode and create orange areas on the ground that will damage you badly.
|tip Try to avoid the orange areas on the ground, while trying to help your Blightblood Troll minion damage Overlord Drakuru, as much as you can.
|tip The orange areas on the ground will start to disappear after some time, so try to position yourself so that they don't infect too much of the ground.
|tip Repeat this process until you win the fight.
|tip If you have trouble, try to find someone to help you, or skip the quest.
